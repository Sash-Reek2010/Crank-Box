# Crank-Box
## Description
So this is basically a box which opens and closes when you crank it. I created it to store my pencils but you can put basically anything inside because its big enough (it had to be, to accommodate the gear mechanism). It is completely mechanical so no electronics involved and i modelled it all in Fusion! I didnt use a full guide and this is only my second 3D modelling project so it might not be perfect. 
## The Principle
So the way this works is that there isa crank that drives a small gear which then drives anther large gear that changes the rotational motion to linear motion (a very common gear mechanism) The up and down motion is used to open and close the box. The degree of open-ness and close-ness of the box can be adjusted based on the gear ratios. 
## CAD Model
I modelled this in Fusion 360 and this project has three parts to it. The bottom, The top and The gears + misc.
### The Bottom
This part took me a long time to make because i had to keep chaning the measurements to fit the gears better. Its basically a rectangular box with a tiny portion of the top covered. This is just to not make the opening too big. <img width="1079" height="708" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 203929" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da42c89c-c4bb-4367-897c-15e292624e84" /> It has a notch and a hole on the side to fit the two gears and the crank from the outside too. 
### The Top
This is a straightforward part. Its just a slab of plastic with a tiny hole which would be used to connect it to the gear mechanism later. It also has my name extruded just because it looks cool! (i wanted to show off at school) The top can also be modified to accept a piece of acrylic sheet so that you can see what you have on the inside but i didnt really like it so i left it like this.
### The Gears
This is the part that took THE LONGEST to make ;-; I had a lot of trouble and had to go look up tutorials to make just parts of the gear mechanism. Its basically two gears of 8 and 32 teeth. In which the smaller gear attaches to the crank. so for every two turns of the crank the box would open, and then for the next two it would close. I also modelled the crank and a connector with its pin which would be used to attach it to the top. I'm really proud of myself because i have very minimal experience with CAD and 3D design. <img width="1183" height="656" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 220809" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b2cd29e-9dc1-4369-918c-f45322bccf6b" />
## Challenges 
I had a huge problem with visualising how big or how small the components are and spent a long time overthinking and doing random stuff while i could've just used a ruler and physically draw the parts down on paper. It is something i guess would improve with experience in CAD. I also had to use the internet a few times for help when i couldnt do a certain part of the modelling.
## Extra Parts
The only extra part needed to complete the build is a door hinge. I didnt add holes because it varies depending on the hinge you buy. Its easy enough to add the holes yourself after printing. Other than that maybe some hot glue or  tape to hold the components down while fixing it.

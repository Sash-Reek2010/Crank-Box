Journal! I finished this project in about 5 hours but most of the time
included me trying to learn how to do 3D Modelling. The rough sketch on
paper took about 1 hour because I spent a while talking to my friends
about ideas to make this and then ended up with a polished mechanism.
The modelling itself probably took about 3-3.5 hours with the remaining
time being used to look up things on the internet like hotkeys for
fusion and some basic modelling techniques. A Detailed Journal is given
below.

Hour 1: Spent a few periods in school brainstorming with my friends. I
ended up with this mechanism for the open and close. It basically has a
crank which drives a small gear which then moves a larger gear to half a
revolution, every one revolution of the small gear, which would push
open the top of the box. It will all be modelled in Fusion and 3D
printed later.

Hour 2.5: Started modelling the box in Fusion. I ended up with a
rectangular case with a fixed layer covering a portion of the top. The
walls are 5mm thick and the base is 7mm thick for better durability! I
also then created the top based on the dimensions of the remaining part.
Its just a flat piece for now. This took a while to make because i went
around measuring my pencils and old pencil case to get the perfect
measurements. I also had to learn a few things through youtube
tutorials.

Hour 4: I watched a tutorial on how to model gears in Fusion and made
two gears. One with 32 teeth and the other with 8 teeth. So that when i
crank it twice, the box would up and twice more would close it. I also
made a crank model for easier use! There are also notches to further add
the connector between the top and the gears.

Hour 4.5: I noticed that the gears wouldn\'t fit my current box
dimensions (kinda sad ;-;) so i made it a bit bigger and removed the
fixed part to replace it with a different one. I also added a hole and
extruded another part to fit the gears.

Hour 5: I finally increased the length of the crank to make it easier to
use. I then changed a part of the smaller gear and also modelled a
connector and its adjustable clip to glue onto the top of the box. All
that\'s left is to model the top. I added a hole for the connector to
fix into on the top. I also branded it with my name! It looks insanely
cooolll!!! I can\'t wait to 3D print it!
